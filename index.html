	<p>TO LEON WERTH</p>

	<p>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. <span>I have a
			serious</span>
		reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything,
		even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs
		cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up
		grew. All grown-ups were once children - although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:</p>

	<p>TO LEON WERTH WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY</p>

	<hr>

	<h2 class="chapter">I chapter</h2>

	<p>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the
		primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the
		drawing.</p>

	<img src="img/hroznys.jpg" alt="rabbit">

	<p><span class="bold">In the book it said:</span> <i>"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it.
			After that
			they
			are not
			able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."</i></p>



	<p class="italic">I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored
		pencil I succeeded
		in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this</p>

	<img src="img/klobouk.jpg" alt="klobouk">

	<p>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.</p>

	<p class="italic_second">But they answered: <i>"Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</i></p>

	<p>My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the
		grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so
		that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked
		like this:</p>

	<img src="img/slon.jpg" alt="slon">

	<p>The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from
		the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is
		why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been
		disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand
		anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.</p>

	<p>So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the
		world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from
		Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.</p>

	<p>In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned
		with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at
		hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.</p>

	<p>Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my
		Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true
		understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:</p>

	<p>"That is a hat."</p>

	<p>Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring
		myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the
		grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.</p>

	<hr>

	<h2 id="bigger">II</h2>

	<p>So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in
		the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic
		nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death
		for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.</p>

	<p>The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more
		isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at
		sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:</p>

	<p class="italic"><i>"If you please--draw me a sheep!"</i></p>

	<p class="italic_third"><i>"What!"</i></p>

	<p><i>"Draw me a sheep!"</i></p>

	<p class="bold">I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around
		me. And I
		saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the
		best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than
		its model.</p>



	<img src="img/malyPrinc.jpg" alt="prince">

	<p>That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and
		I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.</p>

	<p>Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I
		had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be
		straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about
		him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation.
		When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:</p>

	<p class="italic_forth"><i>"But--what are you doing here?"</i></p>

	<p>And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if <wbr>
		he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:</p>

	<p><i>"If you please--draw me a sheep..."</i></p>
